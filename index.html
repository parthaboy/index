                <p>             
            
                    Punjabi culture grew out of the settlements along the five rivers (the name Punjab, is derivedderive <br>from two Persian words, Panj meaning "Five" and Ã‚b meaning "Water") which served as an <br>important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back<br> to 3000 BCE.[1] Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore<br> formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by <br>landownership.[1] The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following <br>the Green Revolution during the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, has been described as the<br> "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan".[1] Besides being known for agriculture and trade, the<br> Punjab is also a region that over the centuries has experienced many foreign invasions and <br>consequently has a long-standing history of warfare, as the Punjab is situated on the principal <br>route of invasions through the northwestern frontier of the Indian subcontinent, which promoted <br>to adopt a lifestyle that entailed engaging in warfare to protect the land.  </p>

    <h1>MUSIC AND MODERN MUSIC</h1>
    <p>

        Bhangra is one of the many Punjabi musical art forms that are increasingly listened to in the <br>West and becoming a mainstream favourite.[2] Punjabi music is used by western musicians <br>in many ways, such as mixing with other compositions to produce award-winning music. Sufi <br>music and Qawali, commonly practiced in Pakistani Punjab; are other important genres in <br>the Punjab.
        Punjabi music started to develop and alter in the 20th century as it was impacted by Western <br>musical genres including pop, rock, and hip-hop. As a result, a brand-new genre of Punjabi <br>music emerged, fusing contemporary beats and production methods with traditional <br>instruments and melodies. Gurdas Maan was a trailblazer of the new Punjabi music scene, <br> becoming well-known in the 1980s with singles like "Challa" and "Mamla Gadbad Hai." <br>Traditional Punjabi folk tunes were blended with contemporary production methods in <br>Maan's music, while societal themes including drug misuse, poverty, and governmental<br> corruption were frequently touched upon in his lyrics.[5]

    <h1>DANCE</h1>
    <p>
        Punjabi dances are performed either by men or by women. The dances range from solo to group <br>dances and also sometimes dances are done along with traditional musical instruments. <br>Bhangra is one of the most famous dances originating in the Punjab by farmers during the<br> harvesting season. It was mainly performed while farmers did agricultural chores. As <br>they did each farming activity they would perform bhangra moves on the spot.[6] This allowed<br> them to finish their job in a pleasurable way. For many years, farmers performed <br>bhangra to showcase a sense of accomplishment and to welcome the new harvesting <br>season.[7] Traditional bhangra is performed in a circle[8] and is performed using traditional <br>dance steps. Traditional bhangra is now also performed on occasions other than during the<br> harvest season.[9][10] Ghidda is also a famous dance from Punjab. This dance is for <br>women and originates thousands of years ago, it resembles femininity and beauty.[citation needed]

  <div  id="religious" class="religious">
    <h1> RELIGIOUS THEMES</h1>
    <p>
       
Religious-themed murals are often found at religious shrines, such as Hindu and Sikh <br>temples.[14] Scenes from Indic mythology, such as the Mahabharata, are commonly found, an <br>example being the unveiling of Draupadi.[14] <br>
Religious murals depicting female figuratives were often Shaktist in-nature.[14] A prevailing theme <br>of the divine (the Shakti) incarnating in feminine form (these unique forms are given various <br>names, such as Kali) to battle with negative forces (that are hostile to the deities and <br>mankind), including demons (such as Mahishasura) and giants (such <br>as Shumbha and Nishumbha), is a commonly witnessed scene of Punjabi murals. <br>
Other scenes found in Punjabi wall paintings seem to stem from the stories of the Bhagavata <br>Purana.[14] An example of a type of mural scene derived from it is Radha being surrounded <br>by youthful gopis.[14] Krishna is also commonly depicted alongside gopis in this sort of <br>mural.[14] Krishna is sometimes shown playing his flute whilst the gopis perform the ras-<br>lila around him or he is shown stealing clothes from the gopis, an episode known as chira-<br>harana.[14]
Aside from Hindu themes, there are also depictions based upon Sikh history and themes, such <br>as Sikh gurus, martyrs (shaheeds), and religious figures (an example being bhagats).[14]

  <h1>  Weddings</h1>
<p>Punjabi wedding traditions and ceremonies are traditionally conducted in Punjabi and are a <br>strong reflection of Punjabi culture. While the actual religious marriage ceremony <br>among Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians may be conducted<br> in Arabic, Urdu, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Hindi or Pali by the Qazi, Pundit, Granthi or Priest, there are <br>commonalities in ritual, song, dance, food, and dress. The Punjabi wedding has many rituals <br>and ceremonies that have evolved since traditional times and itself have evolved <br>in Pakistani Punjab and Indian Punjab.

    <h1>Cuisine</h1>
 <p>
    Tandoori chicken is a popular dish in Punjabi cuisine.<br>
The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent <br>from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may <br>have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to <br>the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori <br>chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has <br>found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the <br>state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been <br>unearthed.[15][16][17] Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which was used <br>for roasting meats and baking breads.[18] Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an <br>oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant <br>spices.[19] According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a <br>similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.[20] <br>
Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice <br>dishes have been developed using it.[21][22][23] <br>

    <h1>Language And Literature</h1>
    <p>Baba Farid, considered the first major Punjabi poet.[24] <br>
        The Punjabi language is written with the Gurmukhi alphabet in India and with the Shahmukhi <br>alphabet in Pakistan. Approximately 130 million people speak the Punjabi language.[25] <br>
        The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to Nath Yogi era from 9th to 14th century.[26] They referred<br> to God with various names such as "Alakh Nirajan" which are still prevalent in <br>Punjabi vernacular.[26] <br>
        The Punjabi literary tradition is popularly seen to commence with Fariduddin Ganjshakar (1173â€“<br>1266).[24] Roughly from the 12th century to the 19th century, Punjabi Sufi poetry developed <br>under Shah Hussain (1538â€“1599), Sultan Bahu (1628â€“1691), Shah Sharaf (1640â€“1724), Ali <br>Haider (1690â€“1785), Bulleh Shah (1680â€“1757), Saleh Muhammad Safoori (1747â€“<br>1826), Mian Muhammad Baksh (1830â€“1907) and Khwaja Ghulam Farid (1845â€“1901). In <br>contrast to Persian poets, who had preferred the ghazal for poetic expression, Punjabi Sufi <br>poets tended to compose in the Kafi.[27] <br>
        Punjabi Sufi poetry also influenced other Punjabi literary traditions particularly the Punjabi Qissa, <br><br>a genre of romantic tragedy which also derived inspiration from Indic, Persian and <br>Quranic sources. The Qissa of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah (1706â€“1798) is among the most <br>popular of Punjabi qisse. Other popular stories include Sohni Mahiwal by Fazal Shah, Mirza <br>Sahiba by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658â€“1707), Sassi Punnun by Hashim Shah (1735?â€“1843?), <br>and Qissa Puran Bhagat by Qadaryar (1802â€“1892). <br>

  <div id="festivals" class="festivals">
    <h1>Festivals</h1>
    <p>
        The Punjabi Muslims typically observe the Islamic festivals.[44][45] The Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus <br>typically do not observe these, and instead observe Lohri, Basant and Vaisakhi as seasonal <br>festivals.[46] The Punjabi Muslim festivals are set according to the lunar Islamic <br>calendar (Hijri), and the date falls earlier by 10 to 13 days from year to year.[47] The Hindu <br>and Sikh Punjabi seasonal festivals are set on specific dates of the luni-solar Bikrami <br>calendar or Punjabi calendar and the date of the festival also typically varies in <br>the Gregorian calendar but stays within the same two Gregorian months.[48] <br>
Some Punjabi Muslims participate in the traditional, seasonal festivals of the Punjab region: <br>Baisakhi, Basant and to a minor scale Lohri, but this is controversial. Islamic clerics and <br>some politicians have attempted to ban this participation because of the religious basis of <br>the Punjabi festivals,[49] and they being declared haram (forbidden in Islam).[50]
